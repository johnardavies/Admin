## Docker commands 

### Building running and stopping a container

** Build container image **
$ docker build --tag container_name Folder_the_dockerfile_is_in

** Run the container (A -d flag runs the container in the background). The p flag maps the container port to a local port on the computer **
$ docker run container_id (or container_name) -p localport:containerport

** Log into a running container, the -i flag is to indicate we want to log into the container -t creates a text terminal **
$ docker exec -it container_id (or container_name) /bin/bash 

** Log back into a container that has been exited with the previous contents still there (the -a flag is to attach to the container) **
$ docker start -ia container_id (or container_name)

** Docker stop a running container ** 
$ docker stop container_id (or container_name)

### Docker clean up 

** Remove containers that are not running **
$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

**  Remove untagged images, the image id is the 3rd field so $3 and then pipes to bash to run the docker remove images (docker rmi) command **
$ docker images | grep "<none>" | awk '{ print "docker rmi " $3 }' | bash  

### Docker saving and getting data off and on the container

** Saving the container **
$ docker commit container_id  docker_user_name/name_of_saved_image:version_no
$ docker save container_name > container_name.tar. # Save to a tar file

** Exporting data from the container **
$ docker cp container_id:/file/path/within/container /host/path/target

** Sending data to the container in this case from the pwd  that is being sent to the folder with filepath :/src/direct in the container **
$ docker run -p local_port:container_port -v  "$(pwd)":/src/direct  docker_user_name/container_name

### Docker-compose getting the latest version of a container

** Pulls the latest version and then restarts The -d flag means the process runs in the background **
$ docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
