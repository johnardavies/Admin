1. Select and launch an EC2 instance
   You are prompted to select an existing key pair or create a new one

2. If no previous key pair exists create a new one and download the file with the .pem ending e.g. file.pem

3. Move the key pair to the project folder
   cd /mnt/c/users/Name/Downloads  # cd to Downloads folder
   $ mv file.pem /home/projectfolder/  #Move the key pair file to the project folder
  
4. Change the permissions on the .pem file 
   cd projectfolder  # cd to the project folder
   $ chmod 400 file.pem    # Change the permissions on the pem file from -rwxrwxrwx  to  -r--------  Visisble with ls -l
   
5. Logging into the EC2 instance
   Select the DNS information from the instance page, it looks like ec2-y-yy-yy-yyy.compute-1.amazonaws.com Where the ys are numnbers, then
   $ ssh -i file.pem  ec2-user@XXXXXX  # Where the XXXXXX is replaced by the DNS information from the instance page
   
   #! Don't forget to check the prefix it is ec2-user@ here as this example is Amazon linux, but it varies according to type for Ubuntu it would be ubuntu 
   
6. The terminal will prompt with
   'Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?' 
     Say yes and you will log into the remote EC2 machine. The command line has the form
     
     [ec2-user@ip-x-x-x ~]$
     
     
#### If a Jupyter notebook is set up, to run this

cd to the relevant folder in AWS, then run

$ jupyter notebook
   
and the notebook will show at  https://xxxxxx:portnumber where xxxxxx is replaced by the DNS and the portnumber by that used when setting 
Jupyter up

if the pages does not load change the security settings to allow the portnumber as an inbound rule

Custom TCP Rule, TCP, portno
